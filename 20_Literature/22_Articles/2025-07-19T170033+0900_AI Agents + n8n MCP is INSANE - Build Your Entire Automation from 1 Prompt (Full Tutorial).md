In this video, I’ll show you how to use AI agents with n8n MCP servers to generate and deploy entire workflows with just one prompt. First, we’ll use Claude Desktop with Docker for hands-free automation. Then, we’ll take things further using Cursor for real-time editing and smarter prompting. If you’re building with n8n, this will change how you work—forever.
